# Collatz Conjecture Research Review - Todo List

## Phase 1: Analyze existing code and extract core mathematical functions ✓
- [x] Extract text from PDF documents
- [x] Read Collatz Conjecture research document
- [x] Read UBP theory document (partial)
- [x] Extract and clean the Python code from the document
- [x] Identify core mathematical functions (S_π, geometric mapping, etc.)

- Uses 3D geometric mapping and statistical analysis
- Introduces concepts like "Golay-Leech Resonance" and "Universal Bitfield Processor"
- Contains extensive Python code for calculations
- Makes statistical claims with very high precision (p < 10^-11)
- Claims S_π = π as a key invariant
