## 2. Operational Spectrum Analysis

### 2.1 Beyond the 0.3 Threshold

**Current Limitation:** Binary operational/non-operational classification

- **0.3 - 0.6:** Standard operational constants (proven functional)
- **0.6 - 0.8:** Strong operational constants (enhanced functionality)
- **0.8 - 1.0:** Core operational constants (fundamental reality functions)
- **1.0+:** Hyper-operational constants (reality-defining functions)

#### **Multi-Threshold Testing Framework:**
```python
def analyze_operational_spectrum(constant):
    thresholds = [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
    spectrum_analysis = {}
    
    for threshold in thresholds:
        spectrum_analysis[threshold] = {
            'operational_strength': calculate_operational_strength(constant, threshold),
            'stability_measure': measure_stability_at_threshold(constant, threshold),
            'coupling_efficiency': analyze_coupling_at_threshold(constant, threshold),
            'reality_integration': test_reality_integration(constant, threshold)
        }
