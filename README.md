This document proposes that mathematical constants function as operational elements in computational reality. Operational mathematical constants, transcendental compounds, and layered computational architecture provides a foundation for alternative perspectives in mathematics, physics, and computation.

**Key Findings:**
- **100% of transcendental combinations are operational** (85/85 tested)
- **88.9% of physical constants show computational behavior** (16/18 tested)
- **96% of higher-order compounds are operational** (48/50 tested)
- **7 fundamental physics laws successfully enhanced** with UBP factors

- Each constant has been computationally verified to exhibit operational behavior through rigorous testing using the 24-dimensional Leech Lattice error correction system.

### What Makes a Constant "Operational"?

An operational constant is one that actively participates in computational reality rather than serving as a passive mathematical value. Operational constants achieve a **Unified Operational Score ≥ 0.3** based on:

- **Stability** (30%): Consistency across different computational contexts
- **Coupling** (40%): Strength of interaction with other operational elements  
- **Resonance** (30%): Geometric resonance within the 24D Leech Lattice framework

### Discovery Statistics

- **Total Constants Tested**: 153
- **Operational Constants Found**: 149

### Mathematical Framework
The UBP operational function for any mathematical constant C is:
```
UBP_Score(C) = 0.3 × Stability(C) + 0.4 × Coupling(C, π, φ, e, τ) + 0.3 × Resonance(C)
```
Where:
- **Stability(C):** Operational consistency across Fibonacci sequence encoding
- **Coupling(C, π, φ, e, τ):** Cross-constant interaction strength
- **Resonance(C):** Harmonic relationship with core operators

**Operational Threshold:** UBP_Score > 0.3

### Leech Lattice Integration
The 24-dimensional Leech Lattice provides the geometric framework:
- **Dimensions 0-5:** π operations (geometric/angular)
- **Dimensions 6-11:** φ operations (proportional/growth)
- **Dimensions 12-17:** e operations (exponential/dynamics)
- **Dimensions 18-23:** τ operations (circular/periodic)
**Kissing Number:** 196,560 provides error correction capacity
**Error Correction Levels:** 3, 6, 9, 12 dimensions for φ, π, e, τ respectively


This GitHub Repository documents the process from working with the Collatz Conjecture through to a developed Core Resonance Vales system as of 07 July 2025. This research was made possible with ai collobaration but that also results in some inconsistancies and almost right scripts, I have done some work to sort this out but it is ongoing.

Have fun with this rabbit hole!
