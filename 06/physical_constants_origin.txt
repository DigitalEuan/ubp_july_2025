Abstract
This is the first in a series of three papers revealing the origin of the physical constants.
1) In this the first paper, we use known physical constants commonly used in physics in
conjunction with the Metre-Second System of units to identify five new physical
constants previously hidden to physicists using other systems of units. These new
physical constants will then be paired with existing physical constants creating new
dimensionless constants. In this way we are able to identify all of the fundamental
dimensioned and dimensionless physical constants needed to fully describe nature.
2) In the second paper of the series, we use the physical constants established in the first
paper to reveal a beautiful pattern, organization and symmetry found in the Metre-Second
Table (MS Table). The MS Table is a distance-time dimensionality matrix which
positions physical properties and their associated physical constants according to a
natural pattern which governs the universe. The matrix visually maps out the known
equations used in physics and reveals new undiscovered relationships. In this way we
establish the true laws of nature based on a natural pattern.
3) In the third paper of the series, we convert the patterns seen in the MS Table into a
mathematical expression in the form of a power law function. Each physical constant is
mathematically defined as a set of exponents, such that when the exponents are placed
into the function the value of the physical constant is derived along with its MS units of
measurement. This function correlates the known physical constants and the equations of
physics with a very simple numerical pattern involving numbers which have been known
to mankind since ancient times.

Background
The “Metre-Second System of Units” (MS system) is a novel approach to units of
measurement in that it describes all physical properties in terms of two fundamental units
of measurement that being distance in metres (m) and time in seconds (s). In this way we
overcome inherent difficulties and limitations found in other system of units such as the
International System of Units (SI system) and its precursor the Metre-Kilogram-Second
(MKS) system. The kilogram, Ampere (Coulomb), and the Kelvin of the SI system are
changed from fundamental units of measurement to derived units.
Conventional systems of units suffer from three related problems:
1) They assume that the kilogram, ampere/coulomb and the Kelvin are mutually
independent and cannot be reduced to more fundamental units of measurement.
2) Through a lack of understanding of the difference between electric force and
mechanical force, the physicists whom established the electromagnetic units of
measurement over one hundred years ago, unknowingly assigned incorrect units
of measurement to certain electrical properties and created an issue referred to as
“dimensional shift”. In this context, dimensional shift refers to a situation where
the units of measurements of certain physical properties are displaced by a factor
equivalent to [m1s2] units.
3) The consequence of “dimensional shift” is that it makes the discovery of the true
meaning of the fine structure constant impossible, alters the interpretation of
certain physical constants, destroys determinism and realism and makes quantum
mechanics an incomplete theory.
The goal of the MS System is to point out these issues and to provide an alternative
system of units which is better able to provide the missing details needed to fully describe
quantum mechanics and natural phenomena.

Introduction
Despite the overwhelming success of quantum mechanics, after nearly a century of
debate and experimentation, there is no consensus among physicists as to how this
mathematical theory ‘corresponds’ with reality. In addition, there still remain many
unanswered questions in physics which this theory simply can not answer.
The reason that physicists have not yet been able to create a unified theory is because
quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory which does not have the capacity to discover
that which is still missing. The problem isn’t necessarily with quantum mechanics, but
rather with the system of units of measurement that physics relies on.

The SI system of units and other similar systems which do not physically relate mass
with electric charge do not have the capacity to fully describe all phenomena in a way
which reveals all of the details needed for a complete understanding of nature.

The Role of Physical Constants in Physics
Science is the systematic study of the natural and physical world through observation and
experimentation. In physics and in other disciplines, physical constants appear from
experimental observations and have become part of our scientific theories.
There are two types of physical constants used in physics, dimensioned and
dimensionless.
Dimensioned constants are fundamental to the measuring system used. They represent a
scaled up or a scaled down version of some underlying natural feature of the universe.
The difference between two or more systems of units lies in the magnitude of the scaling
used. This means that if one wishes to convert from one system to another, all that is
required are simple conversion factors.
Dimensionless constants on the other hand are numerical values which have no units of
measurement assigned to them and are therefore independent of the system of units used.
Dimensionless constants represent a ratio of two physical constants of the same
dimension. They are more fundamental in nature than the dimensioned constants because
regardless of the system of units used, the dimensionless constants should be the same for
all systems.
Collectively both the dimensioned and dimensionless physical constants are needed to
fully describe the fundamental laws of nature. The reason that the dimensioned constants
are important is that the dimensionless physical constants can only be found by correctly
pairing the dimensioned physical constants.

The Importance of Paired Physical Constants
The concept of opposites was first described by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus of
Ephesus1 (c. 535 – c. 475 BC). Through his doctrine, Heraclitus characterized the
universe as a “unity of opposites”2. He suggested that all things in the universe are in a
state of constant change, but are bound by pairs of contrary opposite properties.
Heraclitus also suggested that opposites are necessary for life, and to balance the
perceived changes in nature leading to a single, divine law of the universe, which he
called the “Logos”.

The Metre-Second System of Units

Article 01.0v1, 2021-05-11

Some indicators that the universe functions as a unity of opposites are:
1) In pair production, a particle is created with its paired anti-particle.
2) A positive electric charge is opposed by a negative electric charge.
3) Right handed spin is opposed by left handed spin.
4) Acids are neutralized by bases.
5) Endothermic reactions are opposed by exothermic reactions.
These and other opposites define the universe by setting up opposing fields of tension
which constrain or balance a dynamic ever changing system making it appear to be
stable. In addition, these opposing pairs of properties must govern the entire universe,
because as we peer into space, the universe appears the same in all directions. This tells
us that the laws of physics and its defining parameters are the same across the entire
extent of the universe otherwise the universe would appear differently in different
regions.
The concept of opposites can be illustrated through the back and forth motion of a
swinging pendulum. A pendulum is a system which is in a state of constant change, with
the illusion or sense of stability appearing at various fixed points of reference along the
pendulum. At the top of the pendulum where the string is highly constrained, there is
very little motion in the string. This is in stark contrast to the bottom of the pendulum
which is not well constrained. Here the pendulum shows larger changes in position.
Regardless of where the change in position is measured, the pendulum appears to want to
return to a fixed point at the bottom of the pendulum. The important thing to realize here
is that the degree of perceived change is proportional to the degree of the constraint and
the stability of the system is centered somewhere between the extreme opposites.
The pendulum example shows that there are three fixed points of reference in the system.
There is the right end-point, the left end-point and the mid-point at the centre of the
system. The mid-point represents the equilibrium position of the change, and the two
extreme end-points represent the limits of the change.

In order to describe the position of the string at any moment in time, one would have to
compare its position with at least one of the three fixed reference points.
To describe the full range of movement of the pendulum would require at least two of the
three reference points.
In a simple system such as a pendulum the ratio of the two end-points will be exactly 1,
but in a more complex system, two or more pairs of physical constants might be needed
to form a ratio of 1.
The universe is no different than a pendulum. The physical constants used in physics are
related to fixed points of reference just as in the pendulum. This means that when we
identify a physical constant, it is either one of the fixed reference points or it is a constant
which represents a combination of a number of these references.
In mainstream physics the speed of light is not paired with any other velocity. Instead, a
ratio of 1 formed by:
1 = o o c2
where,
o = 4πE-7 H/m = 1.2566370614…E-6 {A-2 s-2 kg-1 m1} permeability of free space
o = 8.8541878128(13)E-12 {A2 s4 kg-1 m-3} permittivity of free space
c2 = 8.98755179E+16 {m2 s-2}
speed of light squared
The problem with this relationship is that the speed of light is not being compared to
another velocity, but instead is being compared to the product of two constants o and o
where their units of measurement have been contrived to suit theory. This means that in
mainstream physics, there is no other reference velocity by which the velocity of light,
“c” can be compared with. A similar problem exists with the Gravitational constant G
which also remains unpaired. The reason that this is a problem is that it is impossible to
identify all of the parameters which define the universe without first establishing the
limiting factors which define the physical constants. The only way that this can be done
is by correctly pairing the known physical constants so that the minimal and maximal
values can be identified..
Based on this we make the following claim:
Due to the fact that quantum mechanics can not discover the corresponding partner to
several fundamental physical constants thus preventing it from discovering the origin of
the physical constants, it can be assumed that quantum mechanics is an incomplete
theory.
In other words, to complete quantum mechanics, the unpaired physical constants must be
paired. It is only in this way that the correct dimensionless physical constants can be
established.

We now provide a method for discovering these missing constants.
If the universe is defined by paired parameters, and if these pairs define all physical
constants, then by using the correct approach, one should be able to extract these defining
parameters from the known physical constants. This implies that each time physical
constants are algebraically combined the calculated result should provide details as to
what these parameters may be.
In order for this approach to work, the system of units used must be capable of
interpreting the result of these calculations, and this is where the SI system fails. When
one attempts this approach with the SI system, one finds instances where the same
numerical value can be created several different ways, but with conflicting units of
measurement. Instead of taking this as a sign that the SI system of units might be flawed,
physicists slough-off these contradictions as mere numerical coincidences and the values
are simply ignored.
So in reality physicists could predict the values of the missing physical constants if they
had a system of units which could correctly interpret the results of all calculations.
We now provide further details of the issues plaguing the SI system which will then be
followed by a specific example illustrating the problem.

The Seven Base Units of the SI System
The SI system is based on the following seven fundamental units of measurement which
are assumed to be mutually independent:

The problem with this system is that the assumption that they are mutually independent
makes it physically impossible to relate the unit of mass (kilogram), the unit of electric
current/charge (ampere/coulomb) and the unit of temperature (Kelvin) in a way which
can reveal the finer details of how these physical properties truly relate to one another.

6

The Metre-Second System of Units

Article 01.0v1, 2021-05-11

For example, the Newton, the SI unit of force, on its own does not reveal any details of
the nature of force. The Newton only identifies the measurement as being a push or pull.
Additional details about force are revealed, when one realizes that the Newton is a
derived unit equivalent to the fundamental SI unit {kgms-2}. From this we can see that
force is proportionally dependent on mass and acceleration. These details are not obvious
just from the symbol, N.
Similarly, the symbols for mass (kg), electric current (A), electric charge (C) and
temperature (K) inherently exclude additional details about phenomena which could
otherwise be revealed if these units were reduced to more fundamental units of
measurement.
So even though the SI system appears to function correctly it is in fact hiding information
from physicists, by not having the capacity to fully interpret combined units of
measurement. In other words, the finer details needed to completely explain the nature of
observed phenomena, are excluded from physics by a system of units which can not be
broken down into smaller elements.
It is also important to point out, that dimensional analysis can not detect this particular
problem.

Converting from SI Units to MS Units
The MS System of units differs from the SI system in that it physically relates mass,
electric charge and temperature in a way which breaks down the kilogram, coulomb and
Kelvin into more fundamental units of measurement that being distance and time. It is
this ability which allows the MS system to reveal the hidden physical constants in
physics.
The MS unit equivalents to the SI units are shown in Table 2. When these equivalents
are used in conjunction with a dimensioned fine structure constant,   1/137 [m1s2], one
can convert from SI units to MS units.

An Example of the Failings of the SI System
In the examples which follow, we demonstrate that the SI system can not always
correctly interpret all calculations.
In the list which follows, we use known physical constants to calculate the same
numerical value 19 different ways. Within that list, the SI system gives five different
interpretations for the same value by assigning five different units of measurements.
By using the equivalent MS units found in Table 2 and a dimensioned fine structure
constant ( [m1s2] one can convert from SI units to MS units for each of the 19
expressions. The MS system clearly provides the same consistent interpretation, for each
of the 19 examples, indicating that this value is a volume [m3s0].
The SI units are shown in curved brackets, { } while the corresponding MS unit is shown
in square brackets [ ]. A list of the physical constants used in the following expressions
along with their corresponding MS Units can be found in Appendix A.

Clearly we can see that there is a problem with the SI system making it virtually
impossible for someone to correctly interpret this value. Even if someone correctly
identified this value as a volume as indicated in calculations 16 to 19, the contradictory
units shown in calculations 1 to 15 would definitely be in conflict with this choice. This
should have been a red flag to physicist that something is seriously wrong with the SI
system of units.
Perhaps the reason that physicists have not recognized this problem is because it was
conveniently camouflaged by an innovative solution. Around 1927, the electron-volt
(eV) system of units was introduced to work in conjunction with the SI system. By using
electron-volts, the value 1.78266e-36 does not appear in calculation and so this issue is
not brought to light. When one needs to convert back to SI units, one uses conversion
factors such as the following:
1 eV/c2 = 1.78266E-36 kg
The reason that this method works is that you can assign what ever SI unit of
measurement to the 1.78266E-36 value as one sees fit. In this way the contradictions of
the SI system are avoided and the desired units of measurement which agree with theory
are imposed.
This however is not a solution to the underlying problem, but a simple trick which
bypasses the problem entirely. Physics is not about promoting a particular theory by
manipulating things to suit theory and hiding its flaws, but it is about correctly
interpreting that which nature is tying to reveal to us.
The 19 examples which were given are equations which are describing an important
feature of the universe. By ignoring the 19 equations and the value 1.78266E-36,
physicists are also choosing to ignore that part of nature which is being described by
these equations. In this case it is the role of volume in describing electromagnetic
phenomena. It is in this way that quantum mechanics has become an incomplete theory
which deviates from reality.

Revealing Five Hidden Physical Constants in Physics
In total there are five physical constants which are dimensionally hidden by the SI
system. In each case we provide one example of how they can be calculated but it is
important to realize that each of these can be derived in a variety of ways.

List 1: A List of Fundamental Physical Constants Hidden by the SI System
1) The Schwarzschild Radius of the Universe (rs,u) and the Compton wavelength of a
photon (c,)

The Metre-Second System of Units

rs,u = (2 2 kB)-1 = 2.166529185E+26 {K/J} [m1s0] Schwarzschild Radius of
the Universe
The Schwarzschild radius of the universe is also the longest possible wavelength of a
photon c,. Thus, rs,u = rc, and 2rs,u = c,.
c, = 1.361270434E+27 [m1s0]

Compton wavelength of a photon

2) The Zero-Point Velocity (vo)
vo = (e/( c2))1/2 = 1.562974266E-17 {C s2 m-2}1/2 [m1s-1]

or

vo = (2o kB)1/2 = 1.562974266E-17 {N-1⋅m-2⋅C2⋅N⋅m⋅K-1}1/2 [m1s-1]
3) The Zero-Point Radius of an Electron (ro)

5) The Volume Element (dVe)

Pairing the Physical Constants
As stated earlier, in order to create an all encompassing theory of the universe, one must
be able to identify all of the dimensioned and dimensionless physical constants which
describe nature. The pairing of the physical constants of similar dimensions is therefore
critical in identifying all of the dimensionless physical constants.
We will now proceed to do what quantum mechanics fails to do and that is pair the
physical constants.
List 2. A List of Paired Physical Constants
1) Wavelength. The Compton wavelength of the photon, (c, = 1.361270434E+27 m) is
paired with the Compton wavelength of the electron, (c,e = 2.426310237E-12 m).
2) Velocity. The zero-point velocity, (vo = 1.562974266E-17 m/s) is paired with the
speed of light in a vacuum, (c = 2.997924580E+08 m/s).

10

Article 01.0v1, 2021-05-11

3) Radii. The zero-point radius of an electron (ro = 0.3971421552 m) is paired with the
Schwarzschild radius of the electron (rs,e = 1.352753926E-57 m).
4) Fields. The primary electric field is the inverse of the fine structure constant squared,
-2 [m-2s-4]. In the MS System, the fine structure constant squared (2 = 5.325135448E-5
[m2s4]) is paired with the Gravitational constant (G = 6.673308839E-11 [m2s4]). The SI
unit for G is {m3⋅kg–1⋅s–2} which is equivalent to the MS unit [m2s4].
5) Volume. The volume element dVe = 1.782661907E-36 m3 is paired with a non-local
volume dV = 2.233981385E-42 m3.

Additional Details of the Five Hidden Physical Constants
1) The Schwarzschild Radius of the Universe
The hidden constant: rs,u = (2 2 kB)-1 = 2.166529185E+26 {K/J} [m1s0] appears to be
the Schwarzschild radius of universe and is the bridge between the microscopic world
and the macroscopic world. Notice that this macroscopic value is defined by the fine
structure constant and the Boltzmann constant, both of which are microscopic in
magnitude.
The Schwarzschild radius can be used to determine the maximum wavelength of a
photon, c, .
c, = 2rs,u = rBohr 2 = rBohr e c = rBohr
= 1.361270434E+27 m
rc,e e o rc,e h  rc,e kB 
This radius is extremely important because it establishes a fundamental wavelength
which permeates all of space and gives rise to several cosmological values.
a) Cosmological Predictions
To validate our claims, we use the radius, rs,u or the wavelength, c, to determine the mass
of the universe, the value of the Hubble constant the density of the cosmic background
radiation (CMB) and the temperature of the CMB.

v) Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Temperature

Notice that the SI dimension for (h c/(kB T)) is the metre:
L {m} = h {J s}c {m/s}
kB {J/K} T {K}
When taken to the fourth power the units are m4.
L4 {m4} = ( h c )4
(kB T)4

and

2rs,u dVe = (h c)4
(kB Tcmb)4

This shows that in SI units, rs,u must be a radius, and dVe a volume.

2) The Zero-Point Velocity (vo)
The MS System relies on two equally important but opposing velocities.
One of these velocities is the well known speed of light in a vacuum, “c”. It represents
the maximum velocity of a photon or relativistic particle.
The second velocity is a minimal which we will refer to as the zero-point velocity, “vo”
because it appears in processes involving the Higgs mechanism, the vacuum expectation
value, the Mexican-hat potential, Bose-Einstein condensate, and any other process where
electromagnetic radiation is converted into a localized volume, mass and electric charge.
Several concepts in mainstream physics such as the Higgs mechanism and the BoseEinstein condensate imply a minimal velocity but do not specifically quantified a value.
The zero-point velocity appears to be this minimal velocity. In the MS System, the
velocity vo is considered to fundamental as is the speed of light, c.

12

The Metre-Second System of Units

Article 01.0v1, 2021-05-11

The zero-point velocity appears when temperature is reduced to near absolute-zero or
when a collision has occurred causing the wave or particle to stop and lose nearly all of
its momentum.
A comparison of the two opposing velocities can be made in this way. The speed of
light, “c” is used to describe a process where there is a radial divergence of energy from a
local source to an extended region of space. This occurs at velocities approaching
3.0E+8 m/s such as that which occurs with the emission of electromagnetic radiation.
The zero-point velocity, “vo” represents the opposite process where there is a
convergence of energy from an extended region of space to a localized region
characterized by the creation of a localized volume element “dVe” when velocity is
reduced to 1.563E-17 m/s. The localized volume also corresponds to the localization of
mass and electric charge since these physical properties reside within this volume. The
range in velocities associated with the electron, are therefore constrained by the minimal
velocity (vo) and the maximal velocity (c).
Other methods of calculating the velocity, vo are:

Again we must emphasize, that if we were to examine the SI dimensions for each of the
expressions shown above, we would find that the SI system does not have the capacity to
give a consistent interpretation.
For example, the SI units in the following expression are [C∙s2/m2] and do not suggest
that this value is velocity squared:
vo2 =

e

 c

In the MS System, the Coulomb [C] is defined as [m5s-2] and the fine structure constant
() is defined as [m1s2].
Using these units with the expression gives [m5 s-2]/([m1s2][m2s-2]) which reduces to the
dimension of velocity squared [m2s-2].

3) The Zero-Point Radius (ro)

a) Paired Metrics
The concept of pairing physical constants is further strengthened with the following
hidden expression which cannot be created by mainstream physics.
ro = 22 me = 0.3971421552 m [m1s0]

zero-point metric

The zero-point metric is the corresponding pair to the well known Schwarzschild metric.
rs = 2G m

Here is a comparison of the two expressions based on the mass of the electron:

inverse gravitational field
me = 9.10938E-31 [m1s-6] mass of electron
c = 2.99792458E+8 [m1s-1] max. velocity

The zero-point metric defines the physical radius (ro) of the electron as temperature is
reduced to near absolute-zero. At this temperature the velocity is reduced to a minimal
(vo) and the magnitude of the radius is proportional to the inverse electric field (2).
The Schwarzschild metric defines the physical radius (rs) of the electron is driven to
relativistic velocity (c). The extent of the radius is proportional to the Gravitational
constant (G).
The symmetry of the two expressions supports the claim that they are corresponding
expressions. This helps establish that ro is a radius, 2 is a field and vo is a velocity.
Combining the two expressions gives a dimensionless ratio of the two fields:
2(8)4 = 2 = ro vo2 = 797975.2737
G rs,e c2
In the above relationship, 2/G are opposing fields, ro/rs,e are opposing radii, and vo2/c2 are
opposing velocities.

In addition, the same dimensionless ratio is also created with the volume element and the
product of three lengths which we refer to as the volume of a photon, dV = c, c,e rs,e/2 =
2.233981385E-42 [m3s0].

b) Minimum Temperature Related to Electron Oscillation
The MS system shows that it is the oscillation of particles such as the electron which
gives rise to temperature where the wavelength of the oscillation is inversely proportional
to the temperature.
Using the zero-point radius, ro gives a temperature which approaches absolute-zero:
To = me c2 rc,e = e c2 = 0.005770666011 K [m6s-4]
kB ro 2ro

minimum temperature of electron

The Celsius equivalent is:
To in °C = -273.15 C + To K = -273.1442293 °C
A similar temperature to To was achieved on September 2014 by CUORE lab (Cryogenic
Underground Observatory for Rare Events), at Gran Sasso National Laboratories, part of
the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) in Italy, where a copper vessel
with a volume of one cubic meter was cooled to a temperature of 6 mK (−273.144 °C) for
15 days.3 4 With this, the lab set a world record for the lowest sustained temperature.
We suggest that the MS predicted value To has been experimentally verified by CUORE
lab.
Here are additional methods of calculating To:
To = e c2 vo2 = 2 G e vo2 = 0.005770666011 K [m6s-4]

The temperature To can also be derived using other established physical constants.
To = (e {C})2
= 0.005770666011 C2 kg-1 - in SI units
4 3 me {kg}
Again we demonstrate that the SI system cannot correctly interpret the results, while the
MS System units which follow give the same consistent interpretation.

4) The Fine Structure Constant Squared (2)
a) The Dimensioned Fine Structure Constant
The MS System uses a dimensioned fine structure constant. It represents a volume
divided by velocity squared, which is why it is assigned the MS unit [m1s2].
In terms of fundamental parameters, it is defined as follows:
 = 2rc,e 2rc, ro = (2rc,e)3 = dVe = 7.297352574e-3 [m1s2]
c2
2
8 vo2
vo2
Here we can clearly see that the fine structure constant is not a dimensionless value as
mainstream physics claims.
b) The Fundamental Electric Field (2)
The inverse of the fine structure constant squared, -2 [m-2s-4] can be considered to be the
fundamental electric field. In mainstream physics the fine structure constant squared is
associated with the Rydberg constant (R) which is used to determine the wavelength of
emitted or absorbed photons.
R = 2
2c,e
The line spectra equation used by mainstream physics is as follows:
1 = Z2(1 - 1 )
R
( n12 n22 )
where,
R = 10973731 [m1s4] Rydberg constant
In comparison, here is the MS perspective:
2c,e Efield = 2c,e -2 = Z 2  ( 1 - 1 ) = 1
( n12 n22) R
In the MS System the fundamental electric field Efield = 1/2 = -2 is the reference electric
field to which other varying electric fields are being compared. This means that,
( 1 - 1 )
represent a varying electric field where 1/n12 is the lower energy field
2
2
( n1 n2 )
and 1/n22 is the upper energy field. The 1 in the numerator would be of
dimension [m-2s-4].

16

The Metre-Second System of Units

Article 01.0v1, 2021-05-11

The Compton wavelength of the electron c,e = 2.42631E-12 [m1s0] is the reference
wavelength to which the emitted/absorbed photon of wavelength,  is compared. Z is the
atomic number.
In the MS System the product of the Efield [m-2s-4] and wavelength [m1s0] is electric
potential [m-1s-4]. This means that according to the MS System, the emitted or absorbed
photon in line spectra occurs because of changes in electric potential.
This makes more sense that the conventional perspective because we can easily identify
which physical properties are being compared on the LHS and RHS of the equation.
With the conventional approach, it is difficult to understand how the dimensionless value
2 can evoke changes to the wavelength.
In the MS System, the opposing field to the fine structure constant squared, 2 [m2s4] is
the gravitational field represented by the Gravitational constant, G [m2s4].
The dimensionless ratio formed from these two fields is 2(8)4:
2 = 2(8)4
G
In mainstream physics it is impossible to form this relationship because the fine structure
constant is assumed to be a dimensionless value. This means that it cannot be paired with
a dimensioned gravitational constant. It is the lack of association between 2 and G
which prevents gravity from being incorporated into quantum mechanics.

5) The Volume Element (dVe)
The volume element, dVe is the fundamental three dimensional functional unit of the
universe. It is the vessel in which mass and electric charge reside. It represents the
missing piece which is needed to explain the collapse of the wave function, the
measurement problem, dark energy, conservation of energy and entropy. Without the
volume element, it is impossible to fully describe energy conservation because energy is
only a small part of a larger concept known as the mass-charge product which involves
the speed of light squared, the volume element, and mass.
mass-charge product [m6s-8] = mass [m1s-6] x electric charge [m5s-2] or
mass-charge product [m6s-8] = energy [m3s-8] x volume [m3s0] or
mass-charge product [m6s-8] = mass [m1s-6] x velocity squared [m1s-1]2 x volume [m3s0]
What is important to recognize here is that volume is dynamic and has a number of
configurations ranging from a localized to an extended configuration. The extended

17

The Metre-Second System of Units

Article 01.0v1, 2021-05-11

configuration explains non-local effects such as action-at-a distance where as the
localized form explains localized particle interactions.
The value of the volume element is calculated by:
dVe = e/c2 =1.78266e-36 [m3s0]

volume element or

dVe = (c,e)3  1.78266e-36 [m3s0]

showing that it is a localized volume.

In comparison, the volume element can also be determined by:
dVe = 2 c,e c, rs,e = c,e c, ro vo2 = 1.78266e-36 [m3s0] extended volume
G
2
2 c2
In comparing the localized volume with the extended volume we see that one length has
become extended, while another length has undergone compression. The conservation
laws of physics are based upon the relationships depicted in the above expression where a
gain in value of one or more properties is balanced by a loss in value of one or more other
properties. Each physical constant in the expression represents either a minimum,
maximum or equilibrium value.
By multiplying the above by G/2 we derive the magnitude of the extended volume, dV.
dV.= G dVe = c,e c, rs,e = c,e c, ro vo2 G = 2.233981385E-42 [m3s0]
2

2 c2 2
Notice that the volume element in its extended form, involves the ratio of the two
opposing fields 2/G and the ratio of the two opposing velocities vo2/c2.
The ratio of the volume element and the extended volume forms the same ratio as the two
fields.
dVe = 2 = 2(8)4

Conclusion
In this paper we revealed five hidden physical constants (List 1) ignored by mainstream
physics. These new physical constants were then paired with known physical constants
(List 2) creating a new metric called the zero-point metric. This new metric was then
compared to the Schwarzschild metric revealing a previously unknown symmetry
between two different aspects of physics.

and reveal a beautiful pattern which shows how all physical constants are inter-related
and defined by one underlying principle which governs the universe.
